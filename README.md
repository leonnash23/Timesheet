# Timesheet
I'm a Junior Software Engineer in NetCracker. I'm working part time and I need to know, how many hours I have worked each day of a week. That's why I decided to create this simple app. For a start, I will be creating it for PC, but in the future it will have moved to Android.

Also, I would like to hear comments or recommendations about my code.
	
And Ð¼aybe for someone this application will also be useful. :)
